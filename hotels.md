## notes
- we have a 130-ish guest list, will likely split between a few hotels in the area
- would prefer a discounted rate/code over hotel block

## questions to ask
- do you have a discount code?
- what is the parking situation like?
- what amenities are included – is there a pool, brunch or breakfast?
- will the guests room be scattered throughout the hotel or can their rooms be close to each other?
- does the hotel have a complimentary hotel shuttle that can transport guests to and from the ceremony or reception areas?
- is there an extra charge if you want to reserve this shuttle exclusively for your party?
