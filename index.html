          I am a software engineer interested in traffic, ETAs, and how we move. I am currently working as a data scientist on the navigation team at <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">Mapbox</a>, focused on modeling traffic speeds from anonymous sensor data. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area in California with my wife and dog.
