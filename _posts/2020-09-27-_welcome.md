This site will most likely end up being a collection of half-hearted ramblings of new things I am learning, but my goal is to put together some interesting write ups of geospatial tools and algorithms relating to patterns in how we move.

Recently, I've been spending a lot of time using various command-line tools with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data. I'll will be posting something about that soon.
